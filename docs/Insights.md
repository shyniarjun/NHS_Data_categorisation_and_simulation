# Simulation Insights and Key Findings

This section summarises the core insights derived from two scenario simulations: tightening of performance thresholds, and simulated value drops. These tests were designed to evaluate the resilience of existing KPI performance under stress or policy shifts, and to support evidence-based threshold setting in NHS ward-level reporting.

## Simulation 1: Tightening Gold Threshold

**Scenario:** Increased the Gold performance threshold from 95% to 97% for KPIs where higher values are better.

**Key Insights:**

- **Minimal Overall Impact:** Only 4.3% of KPI records changed category, suggesting that most wards were already performing close to or above the new standard.
- **Borderline Performers Downgraded:** Several KPIs that previously achieved Gold were reassigned to Silver or White, revealing hidden variability just below the threshold.
- **Strategic Value:** This test offers a safe, data-driven method to assess the feasibility of introducing stricter benchmarks without risking real-world disruption.
- **White Category Slightly Increased:** A subtle rise in “White” (uncategorised) outcomes suggested that aggressive threshold shifts may push some KPIs beyond defined bands.

## Simulation 2: 3-Point Value Drop

**Scenario:** Applied a 3-point performance dip to each KPI, respecting directional logic  
(`-3` for “higher is better” metrics, `+3` for “lower is better”).

**Key Insights:**

- **High Sensitivity Observed:** 43% of KPI records changed category, highlighting a strong sensitivity to even small performance fluctuations.
- **Vulnerable KPIs Identified:** Hand Hygiene and Record Keeping Compliance were among the most impacted categories — useful targets for resilience planning and support.
- **Early Warning Potential:** The simulation revealed which KPIs and wards may be at risk of downgrade under strain — enabling proactive intervention and resourcing.
- **Supports Contingency Planning:** Leaders can use this model to prepare for periods of operational pressure without waiting for lagging indicators.

## Summary

Both simulations proved valuable not just for retrospective analysis, but as forward-looking tools to model risk, review policy impact, and build confidence in categorisation logic. They reinforce the importance of structured, scenario-aware performance reporting in NHS environments.
