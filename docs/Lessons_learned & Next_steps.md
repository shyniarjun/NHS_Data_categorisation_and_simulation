# Lessons Learned & Next Steps

This project provided valuable insight not only into technical problem-solving but also into designing practical, scalable logic within the realities of NHS operational constraints. Below is a reflection on the key lessons learned and a brief outline of intended future improvements.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Workarounds Are Often the Way Forward  
There was no direct or ready-made solution — much of the logic had to be shaped around real-world inconsistencies. Structured workaround thinking became a critical skill.

### 2. Clarity Beats Complexity  
Rather than aiming for overly advanced tools, the focus was on building something explainable and auditable. That simplicity made the output more trustworthy and usable by clinical and operational staff.

### 3. Simulation Adds Strategic Value  
Scenario modelling was not just academic — it helped surface real risks, supported threshold planning, and offered tangible insight to guide quality improvement efforts.

### 4. Stakeholder Relevance Matters  
While this project was technical, it was grounded in outcomes that mattered to staff and services. The logic was shaped to reflect practical interpretations of performance, not just numeric thresholds.

### 5. Solving with What’s Available Is Still Powerful  
Even without a mature BI infrastructure, automation, categorisation, and insight were made possible using well-structured code and NHS data sources. The result was transformative in a low-resource setting.

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance Logic Resilience  
Continue refining the logic engine to handle edge cases, missing thresholds, and mixed data types more robustly.

### 2. Explore NLP or ML Capabilities  
Introduce smart logic to interpret free-text KPI thresholds and identify early warning signals in performance data.

*This project marked a shift from reactive reporting to proactive planning — and showed that even in a manual-heavy environment, it’s possible to build intelligent, scalable solutions with the right approach.*
